## üì¶ What to Build

- `Todo API`   ‚Äî Implement the API in any framework you want. Node.js is recommended.
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äî Containerize the app.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not include a docker-compose.yml**. We will run MongoDB separately.

## üê≥ Docker Instructions

You must create custom network to run it locally
```bash
docker network create my-network
```

To run Mongo locally:

```bash
docker run -d --name mongo --network my-network -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then, build and run your app:

```bash
docker build -t todo-app .
docker run -d -p 3070:3000 --name todo-app --network my-network todo-app
```
