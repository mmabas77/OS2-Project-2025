  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Finish assignment"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "_id": "661fe0dbcf1aef8a5b5e0a1a",
  "task": "Finish assignment",
  "done": false
}
```

---

### 2. `GET /todos` – List all todos (status code must be 200 on success)

**Request:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/todos

  {
    "_id": "661fe0dbcf1aef8a5b5e0a1a",
    "task": "Finish assignment",
    "done": false
  },
  {
    "_id": "661fe1b9cf1aef8a5b5e0a1b",

  }
]
```

---

## 📦 What to Build

- `Todo API`   — Implement the API in any framework you want. Node.js is recommended.
- `Dockerfile` — Containerize the app.

⚠️ **Do not include a docker-compose.yml**. We will run MongoDB separately.

---

## 🐳 Docker Instructions

You must create custom network to run it locally
```bash
docker network create my-network
```

To run Mongo locally:

```bash
docker run -d --name mongo --network my-network -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then, build and run your app:

```bash
docker build -t todo-app .
docker run -d -p 3070:3000 --name todo-app --network my-network todo-app
```
